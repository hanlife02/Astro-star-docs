# Creating Content

## Directory Structure

```text
src/content/
├── blog/
├── note/
├── project/
└── page/
```

`blog` is for blog posts, `note` is for notes, `project` is for projects, and `page` is for fixed pages (e.g. about, links).

## Categories

Create a new directory under `blog/` or `note/`. The directory name becomes the category `routeSlug`. Using Chinese characters is not recommended.

The `type` field can use Chinese as the category name. Within the same directory, the `type` value must remain consistent; otherwise, one of the values will be randomly selected as the category name.

If articles are placed directly under `blog/` or `note/`, they will be classified as `uncategorized`.

## Articles

Files in `md` or `mdx` format are supported.

Recommended frontmatter for `blog` and `note`:

```md
---
routeSlug: 'deploy-astro-star'
title: 'Astro-star Deployment Log'
description: 'A record of the process from build to server launch.'
createdAt: '2026-05-03 20:30'
updatedAt: '2026-05-03 20:30'
type: 'Building'
---
```

```

`background` options: `code-rain`, `snow`, `constellation`.

All frontmatter fields are optional. When omitted, the system falls back to file path, filename, content, or Git timestamps.

## Special Syntax Rendering

### Fold

Use `:::fold` syntax to create collapsible content blocks, supporting default collapsed or expanded state:

```md
:::fold[Click to expand]
Hidden content can include paragraphs, lists, and code blocks.
:::

:::fold[Open by default]{open=true}
This fold starts open.
:::
```

### Blur Text

Use `||text||` syntax to create a blur effect -- readers need to hover over the text to reveal the hidden content.

### Strikethrough

Use `~~text~~` syntax to render strikethrough text in a muted style.

### GitHub Repo Card

A GitHub repository link on its own line in article content is automatically rendered as a card with icons.

## Static Resources

Local assets are placed under `public/` and referenced from the root path:

- Avatar: place at `public/avatar.svg`, reference as `/avatar.svg` in config
- Article images: place under `public/figures/`, reference as `/figures/xxx.png`
- Site icon: place at `public/site-icon.svg`, reference as `/site-icon.svg` in config
- Reward QR codes: place under `public/reward/`, reference as `/reward/wechat.png` in config
